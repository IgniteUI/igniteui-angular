# Ignite UI for Angular Change Log

All notable changes for each version of this project will be documented in this file.

## 5.2.1
- `hammerjs` and `@types/hammerjs` are removed from `peerDependencies` and are added as `dependencies`. So if you are using Igniteui-Angular version 5.2.1 or above it is enough to run `npm install igniteui-angular` in your project for getting started. For more detailed information see [`Ignite UI for Angular Getting Started`](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/getting-started)
- `web-animations-js` is added as Peer Dependency.

## 5.2.0
- `igxForOf` directive added
    - `igxForOf` is now available as an alternative to `ngForOf` for templating large amounts of data. The `igxForOf` uses virtualization technology behind the scenes to optimize DOM rendering and memory consumption. Virtualization technology works similar to Paging by slicing the data into smaller chucks which are swapped from a container viewport while the user scrolls the data horizontally/vertically. The difference with the Paging is that virtualization mimics the natural behavior of the scrollbar.
- `igxToggle` and `igxToggleAction` directives added
    - `igxToggle` allows users to implement toggleable components/views (eg. dropdowns), while `igxToggleAction` can control the
      `igxToggle` directive. Refer to the official documenation for more information.
    - `igxToggle` requires `BrowserAnimationsModule` to be imported in your application.
- [`Ignite UI for Angular Theming`](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/themes.html) - comprehensive set of **Sass** functions and mixins will give the ability to easily style your entire application or only certain parts of it.
    - Previously bundled fonts, are now listed as external dependencies. You should supply both the [Material Icons](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) and [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/selection?selection.family=Titillium+Web:300,400,600,700) fonts yourself by either hosting or using CDN.
- `igx-grid` changes
    - The component now uses the new `igxForOf` directive to virtualize its content both vertically and horizontally dramatically improving performance for applications displaying large amounts of data.
    - Data-bound Input property `filtering` changed to `filterable`:

    ```html
    <igx-grid [data]="data">
        <igx-column [field]="'ReleaseDate'" [header]="'ReleaseDate'"
            [filterable]="true" dataType="date">
        </igx-column>
    </igx-grid>
    ```

    - @HostBinding `min-width` added to `IgxGridCellComponent` and `IgxGridHeaderCell`
    - The IgxGridCellComponent no longer has a value setter, but instead has an `update` modifier.

    ```html
    <ng-template igxCell let-cell="cell">
        {{ cell.update("newValue") }}
    </ng-template>
    ```
    - Class `IgxGridFiltering` renamed to `IgxGridFilteringComponent `
    - The grid filtering UI dropdowns are now controlled by the `igxToggle` directive.
      - Make sure to import `BrowserAnimationsModule` inside your application module as `igxToggle` uses animations for state transition.
