# Previous Milestones

## Milestone 1 (by January 15th, 2018)
1. **[DONE]** Row objects - 1st sprint (by November 20th, 2017) [issue](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/issues/479)  
	In order to implement virtualization in the Grid, we would need a row object to be abstracted. 
2. **[DONE]** Cell objects - 2nd sprint (by December 11th, 2017) [issue](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/issues/480)  
3. **[DONE]** Grid Row virtualization - after row objects and virtualization are implemented
4. **[DONE]** Grid Column virtualization - after row objects and column component refactoring are done  
	This feature enables Grid columns to be virtualized. The feature splits records into parts, and only a certain part of the record is rendered.
5. **[DONE]** Alternating row style  [issue](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/issues/489)
6. **[DONE]** Ignite UI CLI integration [issue](https://github.com/IgniteUI/ignite-ui-cli/issues/53)  
    Ignite UI CLI will also provide Ignite UI for Angular templates, views, and components integration. All features of the CLI will be accessible in the context of Ignite UI for Angular, as well as the full Ignite UI product suite.
