# IgxToggleAction Directive

The **IgxToggleAction** provides a way for user to Open/Close(toggle) every Component/Directive which implements **IToggleView** interface by providing the reference to this particular Component/Directive or ID which is registered into **IgxNavigationService**. It is also applicable upon **IgxToggle**. When applied **IgxToggleAction** will set its host element as the position strategy target.

You can see it in action [here](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/toggle)

## Usage
```typescript
import { IgxToggleModule } from "igniteui-angular";
```

Basic initialization
```html

<button [igxToggleAction]="toggleRef">Toggle</button>
<div igxToggle #toggleRef="toggle">
    <p>Some content that user would like to make it togglable.</p>
</div>
```

Passing registered component into **IgxNavigationService** by ID.
```html
<button igxToggleAction="toggle">Toggle</button>
<div igxToggle id="toggle">
    <p>Some content that user would like to make it togglable.</p>
</div>
```

Providing reference from custom component which has already implemented **IToggleView** interface.
```html
<button [igxToggleAction]="reference">Toggle</button>
<custom-component #reference></custom-component>
```

## API Summary

### Inputs
| Name       |      Type      |  Description |
|:----------:|:-------------|:------|
| `igxToggleAction`| `IToggleView` \| `string` | Determines the target that have to be controled. |
| `overlaySettings` | `OverlaySettings`| Passes `igxOverlay` settings for applicable targets (`igxToggle`) that control positioning, interaction and scroll behavior.
| `igxToggleOutlet` | `IgxOverlayOutletDirective` \| `ElementRef`| Determines where the target overlay element should be attached. Shortcut for `overlaySettings.outlet`.

# IgxOverlayOutlet Directive

The **IgxOverlayOutlet** provides a way to mark an element as an `igxOverlay` outlet container through the component template only.
Directive instance is exported as `overlay-outlet`, so it can be assigned within the template:

```html
<div igxOverlayOutlet #outlet="overlay-outlet"></div>
```
This allows to provide the `outlet` templates variable as a setting to the toggle action:
```html
<button [igxToggleAction]="reference" [igxToggleOutlet]="outlet">Toggle</button>
<custom-component #reference></custom-component>
```
