## Overview

### Angular Data Grid

The Ignite UI for [Angular Data Grid](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/grid) equips you with all the necessary features for manipulating and visualizing tabular data in a series of rows and columns with ease. You can find powerful grid elements for no-lag scrolling while rendering and going through millions of data points.

Built for optimization and speed, our [Angular grid](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/grid) component lets you quickly bind data with very little code and allows you to implement a variety of events in order to tailor different behaviors.

### Angular Charts & Graphs

Ignite UI for Angular arrives with an extensive library of data visualizations that enable stunning, interactive charts and dashboards for your modern web and mobile apps. All of them are designed to work flawlessly on every modern browser and provide complete touch as well as interactivity. Our comprehensive [Angular Charts](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/chart-overview) component supports more than 65 chart types that let you display all sorts of data representations and statistics. And with the rich and easy-to-use API, you can plot various types of charts.

Some of the Angular chart types included are: [Polar chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/polar-chart), [Pie chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/pie-chart), [Donut chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/donut-chart), [Bubble chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/bubble-chart), [Area chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/area-chart), [Treemap chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/treemap-chart), and many others. And if you look for [Angular financial charts](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/stock-chart), with Ignite UI you can get the same features as the ones you come across with Google Finance and Yahoo Finance Charts.
