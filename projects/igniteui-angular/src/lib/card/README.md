**igx-card** is a sheet of material that serves as an entry point to more detailed information. The cards in Ignite UI for Angular can be composed using the `igx-card-media`, `igx-card-header`, `igx-card-content`, and `igx-card-actions` components and directives. Those card elements ensure aesthetically pleasing design that conforms to the Material Design guidelines.

Supporting directives and components:
**igx-card-media** is a container for images, videos, or any other type of media; It ensures the content placed inside is sized correctly.
**igx-card-header** is the place to put your `igxCardHeaderTitle`, `igxCardHeaderSubtitle`, and `igxCardHeaderThumbnail`; It will also detect `igx-avatar` components and place them in the thumbnail area for you.
**igx-card-content** is used to wrap any layout you want to appear in the content area of the `igx-card`;
**igx-card-actions** will organize all `igxButton` tagged elements placed in it automatically.
