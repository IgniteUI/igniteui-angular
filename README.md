## Overview

### Angular Data Grid

The Ignite UI for [Angular Data Grid](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/grid) equips you with all the necessary features for manipulating and visualizing tabular data in a series of rows and columns with ease. You can find powerful grid elements for no-lag scrolling while rendering and going through millions of data points.

Built for optimization and speed, our [Angular grid](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/grid) component lets you quickly bind data with very little code and allows you to implement a variety of events in order to tailor different behaviors.

### Angular Charts & Graphs

Ignite UI for Angular arrives with an extensive library of data visualizations that enable stunning, interactive charts and dashboards for your modern web and mobile apps. All of them are designed to work flawlessly on every modern browser and provide complete touch as well as interactivity. Our comprehensive [Angular Charts](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/chart-overview) component supports more than 65 chart types that let you display all sorts of data representations and statistics. And with the rich and easy-to-use API, you can plot various types of charts.

Some of the Angular chart types included are: [Polar chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/polar-chart), [Pie chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/pie-chart), [Donut chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/donut-chart), [Bubble chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/bubble-chart), [Area chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/area-chart), [Treemap chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/treemap-chart), and many others. And if you look for [Angular financial charts](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/charts/types/stock-chart), with Ignite UI you can get the same features as the ones you come across with Google Finance and Yahoo Finance Charts.

## Setup
From the root folder run:

```
npm install
```

## Create new Project with Ignite UI CLI
To get started with the Ignite UI CLI and Ignite UI for Angular:

```
npm i -g igniteui-cli
ig new <project name> --framework=angular
cd <project name>
ig add grid <component name>
ig start
```

## Adding IgniteUI for Angular to Existing Project

Including the `igniteui-angular` and `igniteui-cli` packages to your project:

```
ng add igniteui-angular
```

After this operation you can use the Ignite UI CLI commands in your project, such as `ig` and `ig add`.
[Learn more](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli#usage)

## Updating Existing Project

```

If there are new versions available, update your packages:

```
ng update igniteui-angular
...
ng update igniteui-cli
```

## Building the Library
```
// build the code
ng build igniteui-angular

// build the css
npm run build:style

// build them both
npm run build:lib
```

You can find the build output under `dist/igniteui-angular`.

## Running the tests

Running the tests in watch mode:

```
ng test igniteui-angular // or npm run test:lib:watch
```

Running the tests once with code coverage enabled:
```
npm run test:lib
```

## Building the API Docs
The API docs are produced using TypeDoc and SassDoc. In order to build the docs, all you need to do is run:

```
