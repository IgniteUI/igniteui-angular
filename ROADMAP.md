# Previous Milestones

## Milestone 1 (by January 15th, 2018)

1. **[DONE]** Row objects - 1st sprint (by November 20th, 2017) [issue](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/issues/479)  
	In order to implement virtualization in the Grid, we would need a row object to be abstracted. 
2. **[DONE]** Cell objects - 2nd sprint (by December 11th, 2017) [issue](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/issues/480)  
3. **[DONE]** Grid Row virtualization - after row objects and virtualization are implemented
4. **[DONE]** Grid Column virtualization - after row objects and column component refactoring are done  
	This feature enables Grid columns to be virtualized. The feature splits records into parts, and only a certain part of the record is rendered.
5. **[DONE]** Alternating row style  [issue](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/issues/489)
6. **[DONE]** Ignite UI CLI integration [issue](https://github.com/IgniteUI/ignite-ui-cli/issues/53)
