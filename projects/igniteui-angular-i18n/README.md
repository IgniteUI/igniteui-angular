# igniteui-angular-i18n

## Purpose

This package stores resource strings for the Ignite UI for Angular `i18n`. The English resource strings and the interfaces for each localizable component's `resourceStrings` property are stored in the Ignite UI for Angular [project](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular) / [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/igniteui-angular). The interfaces can be used as a schema for creating custom resource strings.

## File Usage

An npm package will be produced and it could be referenced alongside with the igniteui-angular in the clients' projects.

For usage details and examples see [Ignite UI for Angular Localization (i18n)](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/general/localization) documentation.

> Note: The source for the package has been moved to this repository from [igniteui-angular-i18n](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular-i18n) which will remain archived for history reference.
