|:----------:|:-------------|:------|
| `igxToggleAction`| `IToggleView` \| `string` | Determines the target that have to be controled. |

# IgxOverlayOutlet Directive

The **IgxOverlayOutlet** provides a way to mark an element as an `igxOverlay` outlet container through the component template only.
Directive instance is exported as `overlay-outlet`, so it can be assigned within the template:

```html
<div igxOverlayOutlet #outlet="overlay-outlet"></div>
```
This allows to provide the `outlet` templates variable as a setting to the toggle action:
```html
<button [igxToggleAction]="reference" [igxToggleOutlet]="outlet">Toggle</button>
<custom-component #reference></custom-component>
```
